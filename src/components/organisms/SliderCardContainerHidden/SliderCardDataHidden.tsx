I started to enjoy my morning yoga routines where I get my dose of cardio, resistance, and stretching in one place. I could barely hold a plank at the beginning. Now I'm doing various yoga poses that looked impossible at first. My body shape improved a  lot and I am very motviated by both: results and the feeling of progress.",
